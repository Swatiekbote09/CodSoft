# Internship Project

This repository contains implementations for several tasks as part of an internship project. Each task focuses on different aspects of programming and application development.

## Task 1: Number Game

- Implemented a Java program that generates a random number within a specified range (1 to 100).
- Allows the user to guess the generated number and provides feedback (too high, too low, correct).
- Supports multiple rounds and calculates a score based on the number of attempts taken.
- The user can choose to play again after each round.

## Task 2: Student Grade Calculator

- Developed a Java program for calculating grades based on marks obtained in multiple subjects.
- Computes total marks, average percentage, and assigns grades (A, B, C, D, F) based on the average percentage achieved.
- Provides detailed results including total marks, average percentage with two decimal places, and the corresponding grade.

## Task 3: ATM Machine Simulation

- Created a Java-based simulation of an ATM machine.
- Implemented functionalities such as checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing money from a bank account.
- Ensured user input validation to handle edge cases (e.g., insufficient balance for withdrawals).
- Offers a simple user interface where users can interact with the ATM operations.
